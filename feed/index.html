<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Blog Feeds</h1>
</div>

<p>You can add my blog feed in either of the following formats:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="{{ site.url }}/feed/rss">RSS</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ site.url }}/feed/atom">ATOM</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It doesn't particularly matter which you pick, but know that the RSS feed contains more data and is probably more widely
compatible (it should work with ATOM readers too). If one doesn't work, give the other a shot.</p>
