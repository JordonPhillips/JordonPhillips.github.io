<h2>Me</h2>

<p>
	I'm Jordon, a 20-year-old Software Engineer who is currently attending
	<a href="www.rose-hulman.edu">Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</a>. I love learning new things
	and exploring new technologies. Currently I'm trying to learn about <a href="golang.org">Go</a>
	in what spare time I have, and I'm trying to find the perfect project use it on. I've worked for
	<a href="http://www.bp-3.com/">BP3</a> in Austin, Texas, where I developed an internal tool that
	allowed the consultants to spin up and manage EC2 instances with only a few clicks and, most
	importantly, WITHOUT having to bother an admin. None of what I say here is affiliated with them
	or with any other current or future employer; this is an entirely personal blog.

<h2>This Blog</h2>

<p>
	For those curious, this blog is powered by <a href="jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a simple, blog-aware
	static site generator. I'm hosting the site on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>,
	which is absolutely free. Though I would have loved to create this site using a more advanced framework,
	such as the <a href="http://robfig.github.io/revel/">Revel Framework</a> for Go, the allure of saving
	money drew me in. I'm eternally grateful to Github for providing this service to developers.
</p>

<p>
	Additionally, I'm using the wonderful icons from <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">
	fontawesome</a> for my navbar icons, and <a href="getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap 3 wip</a> for all
	my CSS styling needs. Note that, since Bootstrap 3 has not had a full release yet, there will necessarily
	be some graphical hiccups here and there. In particular, the scaffolding is not all there at time of
	writing.
